This repository contains a Python application designed to analyze customer orders from an online store. The application performs several key tasks, including:

- Computing the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
- Computing the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
- Computing the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.
- Identifying the top 10 customers by revenue generated.


> [!WARNING]
> Ensure Docker is running before starting the tasks.

## Project Structure

- `orders_analysis.py`: Main application script for processing the orders.
- `test_orders_analysis.py`: Test script for the application.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for the main application.
- `Dockerfile.test`: Dockerfile for the test service.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to build and run the services.
- `random_orders.csv`: Sample dataset of customer orders.
- `requirement.txt`: Libraries used in this tanX_app.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Prerequisites

### With Docker

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Without Docker

- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/)

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashu10dubey/tanX_app
cd orders_analysis_tanX
```

## Running the Application

### With Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**:

    ```sh
    docker-compose build app
    ```

2. **Run the application**:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up app
    ```

### Without Docker

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

2. **Run the application**:

    ```sh
    pipenv run python orders_analysis.py
    ```

## Running Tests

### With Docker

1. **Build the test Docker image**:

    ```sh
    docker-compose build test
    ```

2. **Run the tests**:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up test
    ```

### Without Docker

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pipenv install --dev
    ```

2. **Run the tests**:

    ```sh
    pipenv run pytest test_orders_analysis.py
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Daemon Not Running**:
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine. You can start it from the Start menu on Windows or via the terminal on macOS/Linux.

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - If you encounter permission issues, try running the commands with `sudo` (for Linux/macOS) or as an Administrator (for Windows).

3. **Version Compatibility**:
   - Ensure you are using compatible versions of Python and Docker. This application is tested with Python 3.12 and the latest Docker versions.

4. **WSL 2 Backend for Docker**:
   - If you are using Docker with WSL 2, ensure that WSL 2 is properly installed and configured. Refer to the [WSL 2 installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for more information.

5. **Docker Compose Version**:
   - If you encounter a warning about the Docker Compose version being obsolete, update your `docker-compose.yml` to a more recent version or update Docker Compose itself.

### Docker Specific Issues

- **Docker Daemon Not Starting**:
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is running. If not, start Docker Desktop from the Start menu.

- **Containers Not Stopping**:
  - Use the following command to stop and remove containers:

    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing customer orders. You can run the application and tests using Docker for a consistent environment or directly on your local machine with Python and Pipenv. Follow the instructions in this README to set up and use the application effectively.
