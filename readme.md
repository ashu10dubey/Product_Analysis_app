##tanX_app

This repository contains a Python application designed to analyze customer orders from an online store. The application provides detailed insights into sales performance, offering functionalities such as:

Calculating total revenue generated by the online store for each month.
Determining total revenue generated by each product.
Calculating total revenue generated by each customer.
Identifying the top 10 customers by revenue generated.


Important
Ensure Docker is running before starting the application. You can start Docker by either using Docker Desktop or by executing the following commands in Command Prompt (as Administrator):

net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service

## Dockerization

The application is dockerized into two separate services: one for the main task and one for testing.

### Building the Docker Images

1. Build the main application image:
       
   docker build -t orders-analysis .
    

2. Build the test image:
       
   docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t orders-analysis-test .
    

### Running the Docker Containers

1. Run the main application container:
    
   docker run --rm orders-analysis
    

2. Run the test container:
       
   docker run --rm orders-analysis-test
